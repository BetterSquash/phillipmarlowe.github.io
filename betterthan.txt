BIt's not a mental blockage at all. You're being beaten by unexpected plays. In that sense, they're better than you. Since you can't deal with them, but they can deal with you, how are you saying you're better?

Work on your positioning and movement first, it's the key to recovering more "weird" balls.

It is true that it’s a lot harder to play some of those odd players. Here’s a thought for you: if they are scoring cheap points, it means you are leaving the ball open in areas of the court that are dangerous. If you are a better player, you should have better court coverage and better shots.

A couple of tricks to remember :

you have more time than you think. Watch the ball very carefully and not the player (because the weird swings will throw you off).

they are not dangerous from the back. Work on your ball control by slowing the game down, lob everything and put yourself a step in front of the T to prevent them scoring out of mishits.

We don’t have rallies. I can’t read the ball or their weird movements

One big potential issue is that if there aren't rallies, the ball cools down and doesn't sit up as much as one would expect. Suddenly it's easy to hit a hard low crosscourt that's a winner because the ball dies so quick.

The ball can also be tough to read since it will die a bit in front of you on a drive so you'd end up hitting it more in front of your body than you'd like - leading to shots straying into the middle of the court.

When you win the serve, quickly hit the ball one or 2 times to the frontwall to give it some life. I find it also helps to inject some more pace into my serve to try keeping the ball warm.

I have 3 things to say:

Stop saying you are better when you’re consistently losing against these players. If you lose, you’re not better. This is your mental blockade. Just because your technique or ranking is better doesn’t mean you’re the better player. You’ll have to prove it by beating them every time you step on court with them.

I don’t see how you’ll get surprised if you hit consistent length. I mean, what can they do with a tight deep ball?

A huuuuuge factor is that the ball is significantly colder against an opponent that doesn’t play length rallies. Make sure to warm up the ball properly. Maybe hit some length shots in between serves and keep on court in between games to keep the ball warm. This really is a huge factor in how the game is played. With a cold ball almost anything is possible. With a warm ball it’s really hard to score points against a good mover.

Good point on number one! I think this is my biggest issue here. I’m thinking that I’m “better” by virtue of rank. Obviously I’m not if I can’t beat them. Total ego thing. I was complacent in my game b/c i was i’m depending on recognizing patterns which becomes kind of brainless after a while.

Personally, I find I have to watch “cheap” players much more closely than classical players, as the shots are so unexpected. You also have to get up high in the court as they’ll try and drop it when it’s not on at all!

What weird trick shots exactly? The answer to unorthodox players is usually to simply play good squash and try to adapt. If someone has a tricksy shot then make him play it from the backhand corner.

Figure out what it is they do well and make it as hard as possible.

For some it just means playing nothing but length to their bad side for instance and just waiting until they screw up. This is of course assuming that your basics are stronger and you have the stamina.

Edit:

Adding a personal anecdote. I recently lost a league match in 5 to a player who I really should have beat.

He was fit and not bad, but his game revolved around playing REALLY soft drop shots that I simply couldn't get to, he'd try to drop on nearly everything and when it worked I just couldn't return them. I won sets where he screwed up his drops too so it was pretty binary.

Thinking back the answer should have been to hit harder shots that he would have had more trouble feathering along with simply playing higher on the T.

If I ever meet him again I think I could win but he really threw me off with this abnormal style.

Your story about your opponent playing drop shots triggered a memory from when I was a junior and attending the Amsterdam tournament. Our best player (bu19), played an Egyptian that only played drop shots. It was the most surreal thing I had seen, and our player was a pace player, quick, agile but got trembled by the Egyptian. The Egyptian went to the final but widthraw against Mueller after one set. Shame, but still an incredible spectable.

Well I'm middling skill playing middle division amateur squash but I take comfort in knowing that much better players can lose in a similar fashion.

You have to recognize that any style is OK inside the rules and you have to be able to deal with all of them.

Absolutely correct. Generally, you should find an opponents weakness and apply pressure to that weakness over and over until they break.

High tight length.

If you are a better player you will have tighter shots.

This takes away your opponents ability to hit cheap shots

As a low ranked player who plays bs trick shots like that , the secret is to play well.

Do not fall into their tricks, where the game becomes a competition of who can play the craziest boast

Instead, play well, hit the ball high and hard, keep it close to the wall as much as you can and make sure it lands in the last third of the court. Beginners like me cant keep up with that and end up losing the point in the long run because we can't catch the ball consistently

Begginers only win by dragging you into their game

Thanks all! This is great advice. There is so much more to this game than meets the eye. I’m glad I reached out. Leave the “better than” ego at the door when you play this game…
