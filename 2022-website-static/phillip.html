<h2>INTRO</h2>
<p class="lead">Hi, My name is Phillip Marlowe and I call myself a "Remote Squash Coach". I create squash-related content for use online.<br>Feel free to connect with me via <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/phillip-marlowe">LinkedIn</a>.
<h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
<p class="lead">I didn't start playing squash until I was 15, which was too old to ever become a proper professional player.  As it turned out, I was probably better suited to being a coach anyway.<p class="lead">Most of my life I have been in teaching, although I have had other jobs, including factory and retail.  Since 2000, I have taught English in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basque_Country_(greater_region)">The Basque Country</a>, Northern Spain. Squash isn't hugely popular here, but those that do play, love it!</p>
<p class="lead">From 2000 to 2013, I had nothing to do with squash at all.  Then in 2013, I started my YouTube</a> channel, mostly because I was looking for something to use my creative energy on after stopping running a video game website. Some of the videos are quite popular and I enjoy making them, although I find it hard to stick to a regular release schedule.</p>
<p class="lead">In late 2019, I had my left hip replaced and unfortunately it didn't work out as expected and I find it difficult to move, therefore I haven't made many videos since then.  However, from 2022, I plan to really take the channel to the next level and hope to reach 25,000 by year end.</p>
<h2>COACHING PHILOSOPHY</h2>
<p class="lead">The phrase "<strong>Presentation is everything</strong>" forms the basis of my style.  Of course, what is being presented must be <em>correct and appropriate</em> for the people learning!  In addition, the style of presentation needs to be adapted to the learner.</p>
<p class="lead">Transferring my passion for squash is at the heart of my efforts to share the knowledge and experience I have built up over the years.  I believe that keeping things <strong>simple, direct and relevant</strong> is one of the best ways to keep learners engaged.</p>
<p class="lead">Going from face-to-face lessons to online videos and other forms for presentation has been a very interesting challenge for me, and I still feel I have much to learn and hopefully future content will keep getting better and better.</p>
<h3><code>DO SOMETHING EVERY SINGLE DAY TO IMPROVE YOUR SQUASH!</code></h3>
<h2>COACHING CV</h2>
<p class="lead">I started playing tennis around 11 years old and wanted to become a pro.  At 15, I discovered squash and suddenly preferred that.</p>
<p class="lead">At 21, I broke the <a href="worldrecord.html">Guinness World Squash Endurance Record</a>, and from that moment on, squash became my life.  I moved into coaching at the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B_KxDIGFR8B/">Wembley Squash Centre</a>.</p>
