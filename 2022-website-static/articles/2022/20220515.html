<h2>The Global Rackets Stringing & Rackets Sports Association</h2>
<p>A new online magazine was launched this month aimed at racket sport enthusiasts and professionals alike. It's not just a magazine though, but a fully global stringing association, whose aim is to bring structure to courses and training around the world.</p>
<p>The first magazine can be viewed here: <a href="https://grsa-international.hflip.co/d75099edb8.html">GRSA-International Magazine May 2022</a>.  It covers the following racket sports: Tennis, Squash, Padel, Pickle Tennis and even Beach Tennis.</p>

<p>If you are interested in joining the association visit their homepage here: <a href="https://grsa-international.com/">GRSA-International.com</a>, they have different types of membership available depending on your interest.</p>
<p>Their website also has more details about the association, the people involved, their aims and business partners, which include Head and Wilson.  There's also lots of details about their online racket stringing courses.</p>
<p>I've only strung a few rackets in my life, but looking at all the people involved, there is a lot of experience and knowledge they have to share and I look forward to reading future editions of the magazine.</p>

<p>I was a little surprised to see them describe , what I call teardrop-shaped racket frames as "Closed Throat", but naming conventions change over the years and perhaps this is a good example of that.</p>
<p>I'm also disappointed that they continue to use the phrase "warm up", when we should be talking about "heating Up" - but that's something nearly every magazine, coach and YouTube channel gets wrong.  As you can see, I feel strongly about this.</p>
<p><strong>To summarize: If you are interested in racket sports and specifically stringing, the Global Rackets Stringing & Rackets Sports Association might be something of interest to you!  Go check it out.</p>
