<h2>Should I Buy Expensive Squash Shoes?</h2>
<p>I often get asked <em>Should I Buy Expensive Squash Shoes?</em> and the simple answer is yes and no!</p>
<p>The better question should be <em>Should I Buy Good Squash Shoes?</em> and the answer to that is a resounding <em>YES</em>!</p>
<p>Having the right teeshirt and shorts/skirt is important to ensure you look and feel great.  Of course, modern materials also ensure your perform better; either by keeping you cool or by keeping you warm, depending on your needs.</p>

<p>Having the right racket, grip and strings is just as important.  It ensures you can use all your skills, style and guile to beat your opponent and win the match.</p>
<p>Using the right ball, is essential too if you want to have a squash match that is competitive, but also fun.  Play with a double yellow dot that you can't keep warm and the game becomes boring and not much fun very quickly.  Player with a red dot when you don't need to and it becomes too bouncy very quickly meaning there's not much running involved.</p>

<h2>USE THE RIGHT BALL!</h2>
<p><strong>For more information about using the right ball, please see my in-depth guide: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/BetterSquash/comments/r7xbv9/use_the_right_ball_a_comprehensive_guide_to/">USE THE RIGHT BALL!</a></strong>.</p>

<p>You should also be wearing WSF approved Squash Goggles, but I will be writing about Goggles in future squash articles.</p>
<p>Over the years I have had expensive squash shoes and cheap squash shoes.  Luckily, I have been able to adapt to what was available, but without doubt, the best shoes I had were the more expensive squash shoes.</p>
<p>That said, the fit is the most important aspect for me.  I would rather have a pair of cheaper squash shoes that fit perfectly than a pair of expensive squash shoes that were not quite right.</p>
<p>The expensive ones would probably last longer, but what's the point of longevity if they are not suitable?</p>

<p>Nowadays, because I am only on court to make videos and maybe do some coaching, I prefer a more sturdy pair that will last me a long time.  When I played competitively, I preferred lighter shoes that didn't last as long.</p>
<p>Decide what you really need: Performance or durability.  It is sometimes possible to have both, but unusual</p>
<p><strong>My final piece of advice is to try on as many different brands as possible.  You should be able to quickly tell which squash shoe brand best fits YOUR feet.</strong></p>
