						<li value="28" class="fw8 mb4"><a class="arc fw4" href="2022/20220528.html">Should a beginner start with a heavy or light squash racket?</a><!--<br><span class="f6 i">A lot depends on you. Are you strong? Are you having coaching or have good technique? Do you play once a week with a few friends or do you want to play local tournaments? There is no “one simple answer” because each person is different. So let’s look at the reasons those questions matter. Before we do that though, let’s talk hypothetically.</span>--></li>   
						<li value="27" class="fw8 mb4"><a class="arc fw4" href="2022/20220527.html">What’s The Difference Between a Stroke and a Let In Squash?</a><!--<br><span class="f6 i">Unlike many racket sports, squash players share the same space: the court! This means that mostly by accident, but sometimes through evil design (more on that later), players can get in each other’s way, but more importantly there is the safety aspect. Part of the reason squash has such a compact swing is the back wall, but as equally important is not hitting your opponent, both with the racket when swinging and with the ball.</span>--></li>   
						<li value="26" class="fw8 mb4"><a class="arc fw4" href="2022/20220526.html">Can I serve Overarm in squash?</a><!--<br><span class="f6 i">Yes, no problem, go ahead, sure, but the question you should ask yourself is what benefit do I get? Serving overarm in squash might make you feel that you are taking advantage of the serve, like tennis players do, but the reality is that serving overarm in squash doesn’t really help. In fact, there’s a good chance you are making it easy for your opponent, and nobody wants that, right?</span>--></li>   
						<li value="25" class="fw8 mb4"><a class="arc fw4" href="2022/20220525.html">Can I Use A Red Dot Ball In Squash Solo Drills?</a><!--<br><span class="f6 i">There is a lot of confusion regarding the colour of the dots on squash balls and their use. This confuses is NOT your fault – it is the major manufacturers’ and the World Squash Federation’s (WSF). They designate the dots as speeds: Fast (blue), Medium (red), Slow (single yellow) and Super Slow (double yellow). Over the years those dots have changed, as have the actual colour of the balls, but the way they were and are promoted is the same.</span>--></li>   
						<li value="24" class="fw8 mb4"><a class="arc fw4" href="2022/20220524.html">Is Diving Allowed In Squash?</a><!--<br><span class="f6 i">The simple answer is yes. However, the only specific mention of it I could find in the WSF Rules of Singles Squash 2020 was related to self-inflicted injuries. So it seems there is no problem with doing it, the problem comes with what happens after the dive has been made.</span>--></li>   
						<li value="23" class="fw8 mb4"><a class="arc fw4" href="2022/20220523.html">How To Hit The Ball Hard In Squash</a><!--<br><span class="f6 i">Everybody loves to hit the ball hard, right? I sure do. But I also want to hit it accurately, otherwise You might be causing yourself more problems than you solve!. Hitting the ball hard in squash is not about how strong you are, it’s about using the right muscles at the right time. That said, being strong in the right places also helps.</span>--></li>   
						<li value="22" class="fw8 mb4"><a class="arc fw4" href="2022/20220522.html">Consistent Squash Training</a><!--<br><span class="f6 i">“Consistency” is a very important word in performance. But this article is about consistent training and why that can be the key to improving your squash. I want to be very clear about one thing: I am talking about the regularity of training NOT the intensity.</span>--></li>   
						<li value="21" class="fw8 mb4"><a class="arc fw4" href="2022/20220521.html">Should I Continue Playing Squash When I am Injured?</a><!--<br><span class="f6 i">A lot depends on the type of injury and how you did it, but the simple answer is NO! Nobody likes having to stop playing their favourite sport or doing their favourite fitness activity, but in the long-term, resting is the best course of action.</span>--></li>   
						<li value="20" class="fw8 mb4"><a class="arc fw4" href="2022/20220520.html">The Benefits Of Solo Practice In Squash</a><!--<br><span class="f6 i">Very few sports allow you to improve your skill on your own in the same way that squash does. yes, some sports, for example table tennis, makes it easy to fold the table and practice lone, but you have to change the table. In squash, you are supposed to hit the ball against the wall and have it come back to the court!</span>--></li>
						<li value="19" class="fw8 mb4"><a class="arc fw4" href="2022/20220519.html">Please Play The Lob When Under Pressure!</a><!--<br><span class="f6 i">Squash is often about hitting the ball hard and fast. Trying to punish any weak return with a nick or winner. The problem with this approach is that we get into the habit of hitting our shots fast and forget that pace variation is important, but also that we have many jobs as a squash player.</span>--></li>
						<li value="18" class="fw8 mb4"><a class="arc fw4" href="2022/20220518.html">Playing Squash After Taking A long Break</a><!--<br><span class="f6 i">Sometimes we have to stop playing squash. This could be due to work or family commitments, injuries or many other reasons. If we are lucky, we eventually come back to squash.</span>--></li>   
						<li value="17" class="fw8 mb4"><a class="arc fw4" href="2022/20220517.html">What’s The Best Way To Improve Your Squash Footwork?</a><!--<br><span class="f6 i">Moving around the squash court efficiently and effectively is key to playing well. You can’t hit great shots if you can’t reach the ball! I would be lying if I said great footwork and fitness weren’t closely linked, but you *can* have great footwork without being super fit, it’s just very unusual.</span>--></li>   
						<li value="16" class="fw8 mb4"><a class="arc fw4" href="2022/20220516.html">How To Choose The Right Squash Ball</a><!--<br><span class="f6 i">One aspect of squash that can be confusing to new players, and some who have been playing a while, is the different balls. The first thing to tell you is that it is NOT your fault – it is the fault of the ball manufacturers and the governing body of squash.</span>--></li>   
						<li value="15" class="fw8 mb4"><a class="arc fw4" href="2022/20220515.html">The Global Rackets Stringing & Rackets Sports Association</a><!--<br><span class="f6 i">A new online magazine was launched this month aimed at racket sport enthusiasts and professionals alike. It’s not just a magazine though, but a fully global stringing association, whose aim is to bring structure to courses and training around the world.</span>--></li>   
						<li value="14" class="fw8 mb4"><a class="arc fw4" href="2022/20220514.html">How Often Should You Replace Squash Strings?</a><!--<br><span class="f6 i">Squash strings should be replace regularly. The often quoted frequency is how ever many times you play per week, change your squash strings per year. So, if you play squash 3 times per week, you should replace you squash strings 3 times per year, i.e. every 4 months.</span>--></li>   
						<li value="13" class="fw8 mb4"><a class="arc fw4" href="2022/20220513.html">Which Squash Racket Frame Shape is Better?</a><!--<br><span class="f6 i">Squash rackets come in two main head/frame shapes: tear drop and traditional. Each have their advantages and disadvantages and in this article, I’ll be talking about them.</span>--></li>   
						<li value="12" class="fw8 mb4"><a class="arc fw4" href="2022/20220512.html">What Are Conditioned Games In Squash?</a><!--<br><span class="f6 i">A “Conditioned Game” in squash means limiting what shots players can play or by giving players specific “rules” or points of focus. During conditioned games, either one or both players can have “conditions” and they don’t have to be the same.</span>--></li>   
						<li value="11" class="fw8 mb4"><a class="arc fw4" href="2022/20220511.html">What Are The Basic Shots In Squash Called?</a><!--<br><span class="f6 i">Like all sports, squash has terms and names related just to itself. Knowing those names won’t make you a better squash player, but will make it easier to understand what you see and read about squash.</span>--></li>   
						<li value="10" class="fw8 mb4"><a class="arc fw4" href="2022/20220510.html">How Hard Should I Hit The Squash Ball?</a><!--<br><span class="f6 i">It can be very tempting to want to hit the squash ball as hard as you can. The sound it makes and the feeling you get seem to make it worthwhile, but you need to ask yourself “What benefit did it bring?”. Unless you can hit the ball hard AND accurately, you might be better to hit with less speed.</span>--></li>     
						<li value="09" class="fw8 mb4"><a class="arc fw4" href="2022/20220509.html">What Are the Lines On A Squash Court For?</a><!--<br><span class="f6 i">The first thing you should know about the lines in squash is that unlike tennis or badminton, where the lines are considered “in”, in squash if a ball hits a line, any line, it is out. One other thing to mention is that the colour of the lines on a squash court is not important. For example, you can find courts with red, blue and yellow lines and they all mean the same thing: if the ball hits it, it is out.</span>--></li>   
						<li value="08" class="fw8 mb4"><a class="arc fw4" href="2022/20220508.html">How To Hit The Ball Softly In Squash</a><!--<br><span class="f6 i">When you first start to play squash, you shouldn’t try to hit the ball too hard. That’s because you need to be able to control your swing. So you start with medium speed shots and slowly begin to increase the speed over the coming weeks. Once you feel comfortable hitting the ball cleanly, it’s time to try to hit it softly.</span>--></li>   
						<li value="07" class="fw8 mb4"><a class="arc fw4" href="2022/20220507.html">Is Weight Training Good For Squash?</a><!--<br><span class="f6 i">Like most of these types of questions, the simple answer is “it depends”.</span>--></li>   
						<li value="06" class="fw8 mb4"><a class="arc fw4" href="2022/20220506.html">What is it like to play on a glass squash court?</a><!--<br><span class="f6 i">A traditional squash court was made of bricks and plaster. It was white with red lines. Some had a back wall made of glass, which allowed more people to watch and gave the court a less constricted atmosphere.</span>--></li>   
						<li value="05" class="fw8 mb4"><a class="arc fw4" href="2022/20220505.html">Should I Buy Expensive Squash Shoes?</a><!--<br><span class="f6 i">I often get asked “Should I Buy Expensive Squash Shoes?” and the simple answer is yes and no! The better question should be “Should I Buy Good Squash Shoes?” and the answer to that is a resounding YES!</span>--></li>   
						<li value="04" class="fw8 mb4"><a class="arc fw4" href="2022/20220504.html">The Power of Practice in Squash</a><!--<br><span class="f6 i">Getting better at something is generally not rocket science. It’s often a case of setting aside time to practice. The problem is that most people don’t like practicing. Especially when it’s hard work.</span>--></li>   
						<li value="03" class="fw8 mb4"><a class="arc fw4" href="2022/20220503.html">Foot Faults in Squash</a><!--<br><span class="f6 i">So the first question you might have is “What are foot faults in squash?”.</span>--></li> 
	        			<li value="02" class="fw8 mb4"><a class="arc fw4" href="2022/20220502.html">Do Not Watch The Ball All The Time In Squash</a><!--<br><span class="f6 i">I recently read somebody advise another squash player to “Watch the ball at all times”. It’s one of those commonly repeated phrases, that amateur players and amateur coaches like to repeat, thinking it’s A: true and B: shows they know what they are talking about.</span>--></li>
