          Things To Do To Get The Most From Coaching

      </h3>
      <h4 class="f3 fw1 georgia i">You might think that you just need to arrive at the court, listen to the coach and suddenly you will become the club number one. Sorry, but it doesn’t work like that.</h4>

  <div class="pa4 ph7-l Avenir mw9-l center">
	  	<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">Wouldn’t it be nice to simply go to squash lessons and improve? You made the effort to book the lesson, that’s enough, right? WRONG! If you want to get the most out of lessons, follow the points below. This is the second of three in my short Coaching series.</p>
		
	  <img src="elite-vs-participation-01.webp" class="w-100" alt="Things To Do To Get The Most From Coaching">
	  <p class="f6 sans-serif gray i">Listen carefully</p>
	  
		<h1 class="f2 lh-solid sans-serif">Arrive Early</h1>
		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">Rushing, not heating up properly, thinking about work, family, school etc all detract from your task: To learn and improve. Being late is even worse – that’s lost time, that you have paid for. Sure, sometimes things happen are you are late, just make sure it doesn’t happen often. Learning requires a calm and focused state of mind. If you are checking your mobile phone or not physically ready to do the work, you are wasting time.</p>
		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">You might not think that coaching is learning, that it is just hitting the ball. But you ARE learning, you are taking in new information and processing it. Any distractions will imped that process and make it less efficient. Ideally, I want you to sit down before going on court to think about what you need to discuss with the coach. For example, what information you can give them about your squash between this lesson and the previous one. I’m not asking for a 5-minute presentation, just something to keep the process of communication as effective as possible. Remember, the coach will almost certainly start with a question any way, something like “How’s the backhand?“. Having thought about it before will help give you a better answer.</p>
		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif pa4 bg-light-gray b">Like everything; the better you prepare, the better your performance; and that includes learning.</p>

		<h1 class="f2 lh-solid sans-serif">Make Notes – Yes, Seriously</h1>
		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">I recommend you make some simple notes immediately after your squash coaching lesson. OMG, who makes notes after a coaching session? Why? Well, firstly, <a class="norm" href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-athletes-way/202103/4-reasons-writing-things-down-paper-still-reigns-supreme#:~:text=In%20addition%20to%20being%20faster,areas%20and%20better%20memory%20recall.">research has shown that the action of writing something down helps you remember<strong>&#8599;</strong></a>. So that in itself is enough reason, but also, having bullet list of things you have worked on during your lessons can help you realise how much you have improved. Sure, actual on-court results show that too, but notes make it feel more deliberate.</p>
		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">I’m not asking you to write hundreds of words after each lesson, just some simple bullet points. You should also write down any “homework” the coach gives you. It will help ensure you know exactly what you need to do, when you have to practice between lessons. The notebook can be used for recording observations of players during tournaments too, but that’s for another article.</p>
		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">The final point is that knowing that you need to write the bullet points down, often encourages us to listen better and pay more attention to what is being said.</p>
		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif pa4 bg-light-gray b">It’s like a loop: listen better, write it down, do it, improve, listen better and so on.</p>
		
	  <img src="type-of-player-02.webp" class="w-100" alt="Things To Do To Get The Most From Coaching">
	  <p class="f6 sans-serif gray i">Here's me trying to get low</p>
	  
		<h1 class="f2 lh-solid sans-serif">Schedule Practice Time And Stick To It</h1>
		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">If you are working on a technical aspect with your coaching, you need time alone on court to practice that. Not for too long because that doesn’t help. Short and often is better than one long session. Booking a 40/45 minute court for solo practice can be too much for many players, in which case, when you book a court for a friendly, ask you partner, if you can spend the first ten minutes both doing solo work.</p>
		  <p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">Perhaps you need to work on tactical aspects of your game, in which case, go with the frame of mind that you are NOT trying to win, but trying IMPROVE. Referring to your notes, you might find that your coach asked you to play a few more straight drives in a rally before you become more attacking. reading that before you play gives you a clear and in some cases a measurable objective when training.</p>
		  <p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">Setting aside specific times to train and improves is easy for me to type, but it might not be so easy to do. In that case, perhaps it’s better to space out your lessons to ensure you have enough time to work on the things that the coach has asked you to do. Ideally, you should be on court twice with the specific intention of training and improving BEFORE you go back to0 the coach for more lessons.</p>
		  <p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif pa4 bg-light-gray b">Don’t just expect to improve. Schedule time for purposeful practice.</p>

		  <h1 class="f2 lh-solid sans-serif">Ask Questions</h1>
		  <p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">As I mention in part 1 of this coaching series, working with a coach is a relationship with interaction. When you have doubts about something the coach has said, do not be afraid to ask. Asking a question now can save a lot of time and trouble later. You don’t simply go on court and absorb the knowledge from the coach. Asking question will highlight gaps in the coach’s explanation. it will allow the coach to ensure that you are told what you need to know.</p>
		  <p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif pa4 bg-light-gray b">Never be afraid or ashamed to admit you don’t know something. If you don’t understand something, tell your coach.</p>

		  <h1 class="f2 lh-solid sans-serif">Commit To Improving</h1>
		  <p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">Will all want to improve. Most want the asy way, which for many people seems to be buying a new racket! The reality is that it’s easy to improve our squash: it’s just hard work. And most people don’t want to work hard. They just want to play, and I get that. I do, I really do. But if you are going to have coaching, then commit to the whole process of improvement; coaching, solo drills, pairs drills, conditioned games, fitness, everything!</p>
		  <p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">Sure, you can go and have a few lessons to see if you lie the coach or if it’s what you want to do, but once you commit, really commit. I say for 6 weeks. 6 weeks of hard work and you will really see a jump in your game. No, I can’t guarantee that, but assuming you are working ont he correct things, then you WILL improve.</p>
		  <p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif pa4 bg-light-gray b">Often the difference between players who improve is not talent or luck, it is consistent smart and hard work. Try it, you may surprise yourself!</p>
