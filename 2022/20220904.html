          Here Are 3 Crosscourt Shots Every Club Squash Player Should Know
        </span>
      </h3>
      <h4 class="f3 fw1 georgia i">In some ways, hitting a straight drive is simpler: if it is tight to the sidewall and deep in the corner, it’s a good shot, right? But crosscourts can be more nuanced.</h4>
      
    </div>

  <div class="pa4 ph7-l Avenir mw9-l center">

	  <p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">A crosscourt is more than a shot across the court. Where exactly should it land or hit the wall, and just as importantly, why should it land there? I was a little disingenuous in the introduction, because straight drives can vary in speed, height and angle, but in general, a good straight drive is easier to understand. Before we look at the 3 types of crosscourts below, I want to emphasis that these are NOT the only types of crosscourt shots you can play, but they are ones that every club squash player should practice and use.</p>
	  <h1 class="f2 lh-solid sans-serif">The Low, Deep Probing Side Wall Crosscourt</h1>
	  <p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">This is the crosscourt shot you should be playing most of the time. With it, you aim to stop your opponent from volleying the ball AND possibly get a weak return. Your objective is to make the ball hit the side wall no higher than a racket’s length and past the service box. It should hit the side wall because that will slow it down, also if you aim for the actual corner, the ball passes through the T area, making it much easier to volley.</p>
	  	  <p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">As you can see from the image below, the closer to the corner your shot hits the side wall, the lower it should be. This is because otherwise, it will hit the side wall and come back towards the middle. Contrary to the image below, there is no difference between the left and right side walls – both target areas are the same size.</p>
		  
	  <img src="/img/2022/crosscourt-01.webp" class="w-100" alt="Here Are 3 Crosscourt Shots Every Club Squash Player Should Know">
	  	  
	  <p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">Hitting this target area takes practice and I highly recommend using a paper or similar target to help focus your mind. Simply knowing where you are aiming to hit the ball and having good swing technique is often not enough though. If you can hit this area consistently, you will find many club players struggle to return good shots from it. It probably won’t be a winner, but your opponent won’t be able to hit great straight returns.</p>
	  <h1 class="f3 lh-solid sans-serif">My advice to hit this shot well is to make contact with the ball lower than you normally do. This will allow the ball to travel further, but stay lower</h1>

	   <blockquote class="athelas ml0 mt0 pl4 black-90 bl bw2 b--blue">
	     <p class="f5 f4-m f3-l lh-copy measure mt0">
	       <strong>PAIRS PRACTICE DRILL:</strong> Both players stand in a similar position to a service return. Hit one straight drive and then a crosscourt, aiming for the target area. The other player then attempts to hit a straight drive off your crosscourt. This drill allows you to practice the crosscourt AND the straight return from it. Try to make you straight drive bounce deep and then off the back wall.

	<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">text 2</p>
	<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">text 3</p>
	  <h1 class="f2 lh-solid sans-serif">Benefits For The Front Player</h1>
	  <p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">The front player has to play everything to the back, so there are no trickle/tickle boasts, no low kills and no last moment crosscourt flicks into the nick.  They have to use width, height and tightness to win rallies.  Because they don't have to worry about the front, they do not have to return all the way to the T, but they should come back at least near it, otherwise the back player won't have most of the front wall to hit the ball.</p>
	  <p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">I mentioned height in the previous paragraph and this is a great game to improve you lobs, both straight and crosscourt, some make sure you use the full height of the court.</p>
	  <p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">Another benefit to being at the front is the opportunity to practice some delay, deception and disguise when hitting your shots.  Can you make your crosscourt drive look like a straight shot or vice versa?  Where you make contact with the ball in relation to your leading knee is often a big clue as to where you are going to hit the ball.  Either making contact in the same place each time or having full control over the ball irrespective of where the contact point is, is a very useful skill.</p>
	  <p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">One last benefit is practicing your footwork.  Specifically, which foot/leg to use on your forehand.  I am a traditionalist and believe that you hit better shots using the opposite leg to your playing arm, i.e. your left leg if you are right-handed and your right leg if you are left-handed. That said, with modern rackets being so much lighter and the game faster than in the past, using the non-traditional leg can work and this game allows you to practice that.</p>
	  
	  <h1 class="f2 lh-solid sans-serif">Benefits For The Back Player</h1>
	  <p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">Let me start with a reminder, you shots must take BOTH bounces before the short line to be considered in.  You can't smack a drive that has its first bounce before the short line and think it's allowed - it's not.</p>
	  <p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">Now, normally, playing all your shots to the front in a real game would be considered crazy - unless you are a genius with touch and control (maybe Ramy Ashour?), but here it's what you HAVE to do - yay!  However, that doesn't mean you should be aiming for nick every single shot.  That is not the purpose of this game for you.  Your job is to move your opponent from side to side.  Force them to hit a weak return that you can kill.</p>
	  <p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">A sensible balance between straight, crosscourt and boasts shots is advisable.  Don't neglect the straight probing shot.  Ideally as close to the side wall as possible.  It's also a chance to practice two and three-wall boasts.  Crosscourts can be played but be safe.  If the front player has not moved out of the way, don't play it.</p>
	  <p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">Next, this is the perfect opportunity to develop better visual awareness of your opponent's swing.  By that I mean, really watch them hit the ball and try to anticipate and then react to their shot.  The more volleys you play as the back player, the better.  But don't commit yourself too far forward or your opponent will be able to hit the ball past you easily.</p>
	  <p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">So that leads onto practicing your reaction volleys, which is hard to do in all-court games.  You need a short, but solid swing, more like a block than a swing.  Watch the ball onto your strings and aim low, but not too low - you don't want to hit the tin!</p>
	  <p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">The last benefit I will describe is the half-volley.  I'll describe that fully tomorrow, but it's the shot played just after the ball has bounced.  As the back player you can get to the ball early, especially a crosscourt and "push" it straight into the corner.  if you have played it well, your opponent might not have much time to react.</p>

<h1 class="f2 lh-solid sans-serif">Final Thoughts</h1>
<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">It's an incredibly simple conditioned game, but incredibly useful.  Both players get lots of benefits and it can be a great preparation game for training sessions as it's not too physically demanding.</p>
