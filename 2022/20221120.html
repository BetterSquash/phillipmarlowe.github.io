          Are Court Sprints Good For Your Squash?

      </h3>
      <h4 class="f3 fw1 georgia i">Court sprints are simply running from the back wall to the front wall and back again. They are used by players and coaches as an easy fitness test and part of a training session. But how useful are they?</h4>

	  	<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">Let me start off by saying I have done and made people do thousands of court sprints over the years. They are like the “boast and drive” drill – everybody knows them and everybody has done them. If you are new to squash, please jump to the bottom of the article and come back after you have read that paragraph.</p>
		
	  <img src="/img/court-sprints.webp" class="w-100" alt="Two people about to sprint on a track" title="Seriously, where are the squash walls?">
	  <p class="f6 sans-serif mid-gray i">Sprinint outside is so much nicer than sprinting in a squash court.  Well, unless it's rainy, windy or snowy.'</p>

		<h2 class="f2 lh-solid sans-serif">For People Who Like Physical Challenges</h2>
		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">Let’s be honest, court sprints are hard. If you do the common “How may in 1 minute” them you are going pretty fast. There’s a huge psychological component of touching the wall just before other people and it seems to be perfect for squash – moving around the court fast. I’ve heard of leader boards in clubs with a list of names. There are even videos of people doing the challenge.</p>
		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">For people who love fitness work, it’s a dream come true. It’s a variation of the “shuttle run”, which is used in all sorts of sports, with the <a class="norm" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=beep+test2">Beep Test&#8599;</a> being a famous (infamous!) “official” test for aspiring athletes and masochists alike. In fact, I think I remember a version to be used on a squash court, but I might be wrong – let me know if you know anything about it.</p>

		<h2 class="f2 lh-solid sans-serif">Why I Don’t Like Them</h2>
		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">Court sprints, or just shuttle runs, can be performed literally anywhere. Why waste the time you have paid for on court by doing fitness work? It seems crazy to me. If you have free access to courts; great, no problem, lucky you, but most of us don’t.</p>
		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">Also, they do NOTHING for your squash. Yes, they can make you fitter, but when you are on court you should be working on your squash, not your fitness.</p>
		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">Lastly, as a previous Health and Safety officer is shudder when I remember people tripping over and hitting their head on the wall in the final seconds of a minute challenge. yes, I promise I’ve seen it, luckily, not with me in charge of the session. Lastly, I have even seen people injured their shoulder by hitting the wall too hard on the final one.</p>
		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">Honestly, the case against them is just too strong in my opinion to keep doing them.</p>

		<h2 class="f2 lh-solid sans-serif">So What Alternative Do I recommend?</h2>
		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">With some small adjustments, you can do something just as useful for your fitness and also for your squash. There are some variations, but the starting exercise is as follows. Hold the racket in your hand, start on the short line and run forward to the front wall and lunge to touch the tin with your racket, then run backwards to the short line again. Do a split step and do it again, this time using the other leg for the final lunge.</p>
		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif"><strong>Progression one:</strong> Start on the short line facing the side wall and turn and move forward to the front wall as in the basic exercise. When you get back to the short line (facing the side wall) , turn the other way and move towards the back wall, again using you other leg for the final lunge.</p>
		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif"><strong>Progression two:</strong> Start on the short line facing the front wall. Move forward to lunge for the tin and move backwards to the short line, do a slit step and them turn around and move to the back wall. Be careful not to twist too much and trip over. That would be ironic, since I said that court sprints were not exactly safe!</p>
		
	  <img src="/img/beep-test-grass.webp" class="w-100" alt="A low view of a group of athletes doing shuttle runs" title="I wonder what it would be like to play squash on grass.  Oh! Wait, the ball wouldn't bounce.">
	  <p class="f6 sans-serif mid-gray i">Shuttle runs are popular for of <del>torture</del>, whoops, sorry, I mean training.</p>

		  <h2 class="f2 lh-solid sans-serif">With Just Two People On Court</h2>
		  <p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">One of the things about court sprints is that you can get 4 or 5 (if careful) people doing the exercise at the same time. And more if you go sideways instead of up and down, but that’s less common. if you only have two people, on court, you could do a front corner to back corner (same side though( moving close to the T. yes, it’s ghosting, but if you feel the need to simply run up and down the court, do it with a racket and make it a little similar to playing squash!</p>

		  <h2 class="f2 lh-solid sans-serif">Court Sprints For Beginners</h2>
		  <p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">Just because players and coaches have used them for over 50 years, doesn’t mean it’s the right thing to do. As a beginner or at least if you are new to squash, focus on improving your skill, game awareness and smooth movement. The chances are it’s not your fitness that is letting you down. And if it is, there are better things to do with your time than court sprints. Okay, jump back up now.</p>

<h2 class="f2 lh-solid sans-serif">Final Thoughts</h2>
<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">Hardcore Court Sprint Lovers are probably red-faced with anger that I would suggest their lovely exercise is not the best use of their time. “<em>I’ve seen plenty of pros do them, so who the f*%k do you think you are to tell me they are not a great use of my time!</em>” they shout. <strong>If you are looking to improve your squash, try my alternative.</strong></p>
<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">By all means, get out into the park during suitable days and run shuttle runs to your hearts content, but don’t waste your precious court time with them.</p>
