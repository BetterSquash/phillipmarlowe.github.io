      <h4 class="f3 fw1 georgia i">The mental aspect of sport is often neglected by amateurs, but that‚Äôs slowly changing. In today‚Äôs article, I want to highlight the importance of mentally preparing for a match.</h4>

	  	<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">This article was inspired by a private chat I had with a reddit user. I currently can‚Äôt do any on-court coaching, so I really enjoy chatting with club players about squash as it keeps me in-touch with their point of view. The chat started when the user, who shall remain anonymous, told me their one and only adjective from my <a class="norm" href="20221010.html">What 3 Adjectives Describe Your Squash?</a> article would be ‚Äúinconsistent‚Äú.</p>

	  <p class="f6 sans-serif mid-gray i">A little mindset preparation before the match can make a huge difference</p>
	  
		<h2 class="f2 lh-solid sans-serif">Inconsistent</h2>
		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">It‚Äôs a common theme club players have; some days they play well, other days terrible. I mean, pros suffer from that too, but to a lesser degree. The problem non-pros have is that squash is just a small part of their life. So many other things are more important. So let‚Äôs look at what they said. He is brown text and I am green text.</p>

          <p class="f5 f4-m f3-l lh-copy measure mt0">
            My main squash adjective would be ‚Äòinconsistent‚Äô lol. It‚Äôs much more of a mental game for me. How I play always depends on my mood when I get on court. Focussing just seems impossible sometimes!
          </p>

      </div>
		
		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">The key here is the ‚Äúmood‚Äù phrase. It‚Äôs hard to suddenly switch off from work, family, school or any multitude of non-squash issues. As I said in the title; you are not a robot. You can‚Äôt just switch on ‚ÄúSquash Gameplan‚Äù and switch off ‚ÄúElectricity Bill‚Äù. Concentration doesn‚Äôt work that way, at least not for most people. So I replied:</p>
		
        <div class="pa4">
          <blockquote class="athelas ml0 mt0 pl4 dark-green bl bw2 b--dark-green">
            <p class="f5 f4-m f3-l lh-copy measure mt0">
              yeah, I hear ya. Being able to switch over from ‚Äúnon-squash you‚Äù to ‚Äúsquash you‚Äù is hard for many. Not enough people realise that that is why a proper Heat Up is so important. it allows you to switch for, for example father/worker/student etc to squash player.<br><br>No different from the ‚Äúslow down‚Äù time for a child before bed or an actor psyching themselves up before going on stage. We wouldn‚Äôt expect them to just get changed and suddenly be ready, yet squash players do.
            </p>
          </blockquote>
        </div>
		
		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">I‚Äôve talked about Heating Up properly lots of times and part of that is using the time to begin to focus only on squash. I can‚Äôt believe people think they can rock up to the club, change into their kit, walk on court and play great squash. For any performance, there needs to be a period beforehand where you begin to reduce the distractions and focus on the match.</p>
		
        <div class="pa4">
          <blockquote class="athelas ml0 mt0 pl4 blue bl bw2 b--blue">
            <p class="f5 f4-m f3-l lh-copy measure mt0">
              That is such a good point. Never really thought about it like that! I should start arriving earlier and having a squash psyching-up session when getting ready. (Maybe not singing eye of the tiger in the changing room mirror) lol.
            </p>
          </blockquote>
        </div>
				
		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">We then joked about how singing Eye Of The Tiger might be a fun way to ‚Äúpsych out‚Äù opponents. But even changing slower than normal and having a few minutes just sitting there thinking about your gameplan or elements you want to work on etc, can make a huge difference.</p>
		
        <div class="pa4">
          <blockquote class="athelas ml0 mt0 pl4 blue bl bw2 b--blue">
            <p class="f5 f4-m f3-l lh-copy measure mt0">
              I know exactly what you mean! Might start doing some pre-squash meditation üßòüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
            </p>
          </blockquote>
        </div>
				
		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">I then told them about a wonderful piece of advice I read somewhere.</p>
		
        <div class="pa4">
          <blockquote class="athelas ml0 mt0 pl4 dark-green bl bw2 b--dark-green">
            <p class="f5 f4-m f3-l lh-copy measure mt0">
              there‚Äôs this wonderful little ritual. Just before you enter the court, place your hand on the wall or door and mentally say something like ‚Äúall my worries and thoughts will still be here when I finish. They stay outside on the wall and will be waiting for me when I finish the match‚Äù. Once you walk onto court, it‚Äôs all about the squash‚Äù. It may take a few tries until it helps, but it most cases, when done seriously, it really does help.
            </p>
          </blockquote>
        </div>
		
		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">To which they replied:</p>
		
        <div class="pa4">
          <blockquote class="athelas ml0 mt0 pl4 blue bl bw2 b--blue">
            <p class="f5 f4-m f3-l lh-copy measure mt0">
              Yeah I can believe that! I would certainly give it a go. A guy I played with a while ago does similar when he‚Äôs putting his kit on. Says he leaves his problems in his squash bag!
            </p>
          </blockquote>
        </div>
				
		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">Which is another nice way of thinking about the idea of ‚Äúleaving your worries behind‚Äù. Never underestimate the power of routine and habit. The first few times you try something like this, it might not work, but don‚Äôt give up too soon. The mind works in strange ways.</p>
		<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">And then, a few days later, I received this message:</p>
		
        <div class="pa4">
          <blockquote class="athelas ml0 mt0 pl4 blue bl bw2 b--blue">
            <p class="f5 f4-m f3-l lh-copy measure mt0">
              Had a good game last night! Really tried to get into ‚Äòthe zone‚Äô mentally before I got on the court and i think it worked well! Found I was much more focused. So thanks for the advice!
            </p>

<h2 class="f2 lh-solid sans-serif">Final Thoughts</h2>
<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">We accept that our body‚Äôs need to heat up before physical exertion, why not our minds? I guarantee you that no professional squash player, or any sport for that matter, would expect to walk out of a business meeting, just in the car, get to the club, change into their kit and play great squash.</p>
<p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure sans-serif">Preparation is needed. Even 5 minutes sitting quietly in your kit can help. I‚Äôve mentioned the technique of touching the wall to ‚Äúleave your worries behind‚Äù and there are other ways to block out the distractions, but the first step is getting to the club in plenty of time to allow yourself the opportunity to do them.</p>
